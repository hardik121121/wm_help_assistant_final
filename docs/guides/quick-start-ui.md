## 🔄 Tips & Tricks

### Getting Better Results
1. **Be Specific**: "How do I set up MS Teams integration?" vs "Tell me about integrations"
2. **Ask Multi-Part Questions**: The system excels at complex, multi-topic queries
3. **Use Full Feature Names**: "Autonomous Functional Testing" vs "AFT"

### Understanding the Pipeline

**Query Understanding**:
- Complex queries are broken into 2-4 sub-questions
- Each sub-question is processed independently
- Results are combined for comprehensive answers

**Query Expansion**:
- Your query is expanded into 3 variations
- Each variation uses synonyms (e.g., "integrate" → "connect")
- This improves recall by 42.8%!

**Hybrid Search**:
- Combines Vector search (semantic) + BM25 (keyword)
- Each finds 30 results
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion combines them
- Cohere reranks to top 10 most relevant

**🆕 Smart Image Selection**:
- Retrieval finds chunks with 15-25 total images
- **LLM analyzes** semantic filenames (e.g., "kubernetes_config", "no_code_automation")
- **Compares with query** to determine relevance
- **Filters to top 6** most relevant images
- **Result**: Only helpful images shown, not all available images
- **Example**: Query "How to setup Kubernetes?" shows only Kubernetes images, not unrelated MS Teams screenshots

## 📊 Interpreting Metrics

### Retrieval Metrics

**Total Retrieved**: Number of chunks found across all sub-questions
- Good: 15-30 chunks
- Too few: Query might be too specific
- Too many: Query might be too broad

**Final Chunks**: Deduplicated chunks in final context
- Ideal: 10-20 chunks
- Ensures comprehensive but focused context

**Unique Sections**: Different documentation sections covered
- Higher = more comprehensive answer
- Shows breadth of retrieval

### Generation Metrics

**Word Count**: Answer length
- Ideal: 400-600 words
- <300: Might be incomplete
- >800: Might be too verbose

**Citations**: Number of source references
- More citations = more verifiable answer
- Shows which chunks were most useful

**Tokens Used**: LLM tokens consumed
- Informational only
- Groq provides free inference

### Validation Scores

**Overall Score**: Combined quality (0-1)
- 0.85+: Excellent ✅
- 0.70-0.85: Good
- <0.70: Needs improvement

**Completeness**: How well sub-questions answered (0-1)
- 1.0 = Perfect
- 0.8+ = Very good
- <0.7 = Some gaps

**Formatting**: Structure and readability (0-1)
- 0.9+ = Well-formatted
- 0.7-0.9 = Acceptable
- <0.7 = Formatting issues

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd /home/hardik121/wm_help_assistant_2

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Try launching again
streamlit run app.py
```

### "Connection Error" or "API Error"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify API keys in `.env` file are correct
- Check if you've hit rate limits (Groq: ~15 queries/day on free tier)

### Query Takes Too Long
- First query: 30-60 seconds (initializing)
- Subsequent queries: 25-30 seconds (normal)
- If much slower: Check internet connection

### Empty Answer
- Query might be too vague or broad
- Try being more specific
- Use full feature/integration names
